Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by using `public constant` hash digests: ``` bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\"MY_ROLE\"); ``` Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a function call, use {hasRole}: ``` function foo() public {     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));     ... } ``` Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}. By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using {_setRoleAdmin}. WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure accounts that have been granted it.","events":{"RoleGranted(bytes32,address,address)":{"details":"Emitted when `account` is granted `role`. `sender` is the account that originated the contract call, an admin role bearer except when using {_setupRole}."},"RoleRevoked(bytes32,address,address)":{"details":"Emitted when `account` is revoked `role`. `sender` is the account that originated the contract call:   - if using `revokeRole`, it is the admin role bearer   - if using `renounceRole`, it is the role bearer (i.e. `account`)"}},"kind":"dev","methods":{"getRoleAdmin(bytes32)":{"details":"Returns the admin role that controls `role`.
